    * GPS & Battery Included
    * ~$40 USD
    * IP65 case
* Cons

* Pros
    * Low power usage
    * Modular (Can easily add on gps and sensors)
    * Dedicated solar input

* Pros
    * battery efficient
    * Integrated gps
    * Nicest form factor
    * Fully built with case

    * A bit expensive

    * Custom designed for excellent Meshtastic performance
    * Supports for more powerful RF, for Amateur licensed usage.
