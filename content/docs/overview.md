Meshtastic is an open-source project that allows people to communicate over long distances without relying on traditional cellular networks or Wi-Fi. It uses affordable devices equipped with LoRa (Long Range) technology to create a mesh network, enabling text messaging and GPS location sharing even in remote areas. Ideal for outdoor adventures, emergency situations, and local events, Meshtastic provides a simple and reliable way to stay connected when other communication methods are unavailable.
