## Meshtastic Net
I will keep it open from 5-6pm for checkins so you do not have to rush. The message format will just be (LONG NAME) - (CITY YOU ARE IN) #BayMeshNet. So for example I would do Ko6cnt Base - Santa Clara #BayMeshNet. 

## Voice Call
Also at the same time at 5pm we will be holding a voice call in the discord voice channel. It will be more like a general purpose discussion of all things Meshtastic in the Bay.
